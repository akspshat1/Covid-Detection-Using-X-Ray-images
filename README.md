Automated COVID-19 Diagnosis from Chest X-Ray Images
Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end deep learning pipeline designed for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. The pipeline integrates various machine learning and deep learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Key Features
Multi-Model Approach: Utilized a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM) and deep learning models (Neural Networks, CNN) to build a robust diagnostic tool.
High Accuracy and Recall: Achieved an Accuracy of 93% and a Recall of 89%, ensuring reliable detection of COVID-19 cases.
End-to-End Automation: From data preprocessing to model deployment, the pipeline automates the entire diagnostic process.
